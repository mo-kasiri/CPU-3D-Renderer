# CPU Based 3D Rendering
In this repo, I try to develope a simple (c based) 3D renderer, which works entirely on the CPU.

## Setup
Install [MinGW](https://www.mingw-w64.org/downloads/).
Run this followed commands:

``` bash
# Compiling the project on your computer
make

# Running the application
make run
```

# Soloution for Possible Errors
1. Windows users can use WSL.
2. You must install SDL2 library:
```bash
sudo apt install build-essential
sudo apt install libsdl2-dev
```
